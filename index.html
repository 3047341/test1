    <h1>My Kerry Blue</h1>
    <img src="images/KerryBlue.jpg" alt="My test image">
    <p>Puppies are born black; the blue appears gradually as the puppy grows older, usually up to 2 years of age. The male Kerry Blue is usually 45–50 cm (18–20 in) tall at the withers and weighs 13.6–18 kg (30–40 lb), while the female is usually 43–48 cm (17–19 in) and 12–16.3 kg (26–36 lb).  The coat is the key feature of the Kerry. It is soft and wavy with no undercoat. The 'texture' feels like a combination of fine human hair and wool. It does not shed but continues to grow throughout the year. This means the Kerry Blue requires very regular grooming (at least once per week) and clipping an average of every 6 weeks.
